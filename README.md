# WindowsManagement
Repository of Windows Deployment Scripts
This script can auto reboot a windows UEFI configured PC into WinPE without the need of a boot disk or physical access to the machine. 
The content of a WinPE ISO should be copied to C:\WinPE\ before running this script.
Changing the path variable to winload.exe instead of winload.efi will allow for legacy boot options
